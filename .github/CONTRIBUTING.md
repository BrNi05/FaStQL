# How to Contribute to FaStQL

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the FaStQL project.

You can find more details in the [README](https://github.com/BrNi05/FaStQL/blob/main/README.md).

Additionally, take a look at the dedicated [Wiki page](https://github.com/BrNi05/DiscOS/wiki/11.-Contributing-to-DiscOS) from another project of mine - the contribution process is very similar.
